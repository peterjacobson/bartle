## What?
1. Get a deck
2. Play the game *with 2-10 people (best with four or more)*
3. Hack it

## How do I play?

### Vanilla rules
1. Deal each player eight works from the deck
2. One player becomes the Poser... ...of the question - for example:
  - What is love?
  - Why do christmas trees represent christmas?
  - Why do we create music?
  - Why do we work?
  - What is courage?
  - Why do I see red?
  - What is our place in the universe?
  - What is evil?
  - Where does injustice live?
  - Why do I see beauty?
  - What is madness?
  - Why do we create games like these?
3. All other players are the Ponderers. Each Ponderer looks through their hand to find a work that best answers the question.
4. The Poser makes sure everyone has chosen a work
5. The Poser counts down to the showdown with "Bartle, Bartle, BARTLE!"
6. On the final "BARTLE!" all Ponderers reveal their chosen work to the Poser.
7. The Poser asks each Ponderer (starting from the Ponderer on their left) to explain how their work answers the question.
8. The Poser chooses a winning answer
9. The winning Ponderer adds the winning work to their Win! pile
10. All other works are added to the bottom of the deck
11. All Ponderers draw another work from the deck (all players should always have eight cards in their hand)

### Alternative Rules:
Make pull requests to add links to your modified Bartle! (see 'Hack it' section for guidelines)
- [childrenhack example](#)
- *add a link to your fork here with a Pull Request!*

## How do I get a deck?
Hunt for a range of different works of art - different styles (1800's, 1970's, 2000's) and types (paintings, sculptures, photos, drawings).  
The works don't really have to be of the same size.  
About 30 works will be enough to start with, but the more you can get the more awesome it'll be!

Try one, or a combination of these:
- Cut up cheap second hand art books. [list of good books to hack into Bartle](/bartleable-books.md)
- Draw your own
- Print from photographs
- Print from [Creative Commons search query='Art'](https://www.google.co.nz/search?site=imghp&tbm=isch&q=art&tbs=sur:fc&gws_rd=cr&ei=Xx99VquCEoeqjwOV3KSICQ)
- Play in a gallery with real life art

## Hack it!
- Found some tweaks to make it better? [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), make your awesome changes and make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with:
  - Your improvements to this repo, or
  - An additional link to your fork in the 'Alternative Rules' list
- Surely the Poser should be wearing something ridiculous... a monacle?
- Can it be played in a gallery?
- Travel Bartle?
- Add your own works to the decks, and share them with #bartle
- Build epic decks, share them!
